									<h1>Who are we?</h1></h1>
									<p> Funded by an NSF RCN-UBE grant (and defunded as part of the broader anti-DEI purge across
						        federal science agencies), the Expanding Epistemic Boundaries in Biology Education Research
						        (EEBBER) group convened a transdisciplinary community of educators, researchers, and makers
						        to imagine what biology education research could become when justice, care, and lived
						        experience are centered. In considering what form our scholarly contributions might take, the
						        group turned to zine-making as one approach to disrupt conventional modes of knowledge
						        production and embrace a more raw and vulnerable approach that resists the status quo.
									</p>
									 <p>
						        We would like to invite you to our zine community. Contact us via email if you would like to
						        join our virtual community or pitch a zine idea at lovingdisruptions[at]gmail.com

									In the months following our initial convening, we were inspired to create a zine that captured the
transformative experience of being in community with a diverse group of scholars committed to
a more just STEM. We met regularly over Zoom, using the online design tool, Canva, to
collaboratively document what this experience meant to each of us through photos, drawings,
cartoons, and written reflections. Our zine captured both process and product. The process
included co-constructing group norms, developing shared definitions of important foundational
concepts and theoretical framings, and navigating tensions that emerged from disciplinary
differences and communication styles. The products included curated reading lists we hope to
share with colleagues interested in exploring justice-oriented approaches to STEM education and
the outline of a handbook on Critical Biology Education Research, including discussions of
multiple epistemologies, diverse onto-epistemic positions, and frameworks and methodologies
that could inform a more liberatory postsecondary biology research and education.
</p>
								<p>Since the creation of our first zine, Loving Disruption Vol. 1: Our Inaugural Convening, the
group has gone on to publish a second volume, Loving Disruptions Vol. 2: Forbidden
Knowledge. This issue centers on the theme of “knowledge considered too sensitive, dangerous,
or taboo to produce” (Kempner, Merz, & Bosk, 2011). We reflected on the ways our work,
which centers Black, Brown, Queer, and Trans experiences, has been further marginalized by
Executive Orders issued by the Trump Administration. To further explore this theme, the group
facilitated a zine-making workshop at the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education
Research (SABER) East Regional meeting. The session invited participants to reflect on a
recently circulated list of “trigger” or “banned” words flagged in National Science Foundation
grant proposals, culminating in much needed community building during a challenging time and
the collaborative creation of a long-form zine titled: BANNED.
